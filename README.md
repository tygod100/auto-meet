# auto-meet
this will automatically open zoom, google meed, or whatever it is you need for you meetings

# how to use
In the same folder as the **"auto meet.py"** file (or the .exe when I get to making that), make a **"meetings.txt"** file. _Note that is is **case sestive**; the file name **"Meetings.txt"** won't work but **"meetings.txt"** will, this is because the former had an uppercase._

In put in every line in the txt file the data, this is in 3 parts each seprated by a space. The first part is the hour of the meeting, in the second part is the minute, and the third is the meeting's url. _Note that this uses a **24 hour** clock; **2 0** is **2-am** and **14 0** is **2-pm**._

## data examples
> 5 55 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meeting

_this will open (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meeting) on 5:55 am_

.

> 14 23 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock

_this will open (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock) on 2:23 pm_

After this if verything is correct just run the "auto meet.py" file and leve the window open.
